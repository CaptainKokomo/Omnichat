# Next Steps for Pushing to GitHub

To publish the repository to GitHub now that the remote is configured, sign in with credentials that have access to `https://github.com/Captainkokmo/Omnichat.git`.

1. Generate a fine-grained personal access token (PAT) from GitHub with `repo` scope, or ensure that GitHub CLI is authenticated with `gh auth login`.
2. Retry the push: `git push -u origin main`.
3. When prompted for the username, enter your GitHub username. For the password, paste the PAT (or use `gh auth setup-git` to store credentials).
4. Confirm the branch appears on GitHub and optionally configure branch protection on `main`.

If multi-factor authentication is enabled, the PAT must be created with the appropriate scopes because account passwords no longer work for Git operations.
