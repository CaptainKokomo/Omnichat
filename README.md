# Omnichat

## Double-click install
1. Download the Omnichat package and place `OmnichatSetup.bat` anywhere you like (your Desktop works great).
2. Double-click **OmnichatSetup.bat**. It quietly downloads the Electron runtime, installs Omnichat into your profile, and creates a desktop shortcut without leaving any command windows open.
3. When the installer finishes it launches Omnichat automatically. You can reopen it anytime from the new desktop shortcut.
