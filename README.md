# Omnichat

## Double-click install
1. Download the Omnichat package and place `OmnichatSetup.vbs` anywhere you like (your Desktop works great).
2. Double-click **OmnichatSetup.vbs**. The window stays out of your way while it downloads the Electron runtime, installs Omnichat into your profile, and creates a desktop shortcut.
3. When the installer finishes it launches Omnichat automatically. You can reopen it anytime from the new desktop shortcut.

## Contents
- `OmnichatSetup.vbs` — single-file Windows installer (no PowerShell, CMD, or HTML required).
- `app/` — Omnichat Electron application source for maintainers.
- `package.json` — metadata for building the Electron app from source if needed.
